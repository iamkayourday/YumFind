            className="text-[#1e1e1f] dark:text-white"
          >
            You can use the search bar at the top of the homepage to search for
            recipes by name. Simply enter a recipe title to find what you're
            looking for (e.g., sushi, shawarma, cake) in the search bar.

            At the moment, YumFind does not support recipe submissions directly
            through the platform. The recipes available come from a collection
            provided from an external API.

            Easily save recipes by clicking the "Bookmark" button on the recipe
            page. Access your saved recipes anytime on the Favorites page.
